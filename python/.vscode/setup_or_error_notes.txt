This message occurs now that the default branch has been renamed to "main", but your clone is still attempting to pull from "master".

To resolve this issue, run the following CLI commands in your local cloned repository:

git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a

This will allow you to continue to pull the latest commits as usual.
